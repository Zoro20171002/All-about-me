The writing sample "The Economic Value of the Country Image" is what I submit as the part of my PhD application. This writing sample is based on Melitz (2003) and trying to solve the general equilibrium when there is demand shiftor in the utility function. In addition, I provide a brief structural estimation of the model based on the data collected in Maryland University. Another paper "Fertility, Migration and Capital Flows in China" is part of the project I am currently engaging in to provide the explanations on why foreign reserve in China grew steadily over 12 years but now gets stuck. This explanation stands on the perspective of the asset demand side besides the supply side proposed by Sone et al. (2011).
